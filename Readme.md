# Chronoeffector AI Framework

**Chronoeffector AI** is a decentralized, permissionless, and autonomous AI framework designed to empower AI-driven agents within the Solana ecosystem. This repository contains a proof-of-concept implementation in Python 3, showcasing key features such as decentralized execution, dynamic AI agent loading, trustless task consensus, and a FastAPI-based orchestrator for managing agents dynamically.

## Overview
Chronoeffector AI aims to redefine AI autonomy in Web3 by providing a decentralized infrastructure for deploying and managing AI agents on Solana. This repository includes two main components:
1. **Conceptual Framework**: A Python script simulating core features like decentralized execution, staking, and trustless consensus.
2. **FastAPI Orchestrator**: A RESTful API for dynamically loading, executing, and unloading AI agents at runtime.

This is a prototype implementation, intended as a starting point for further development into a fully Solana-integrated system.

## Features
- **Decentralized Execution**: Simulated via a smart contract-like structure and validator consensus.
- **Dynamic Agent Loading**: Agents can be deployed and unloaded without downtime, both in the conceptual framework and via the FastAPI orchestrator.
- **Trustless Consensus**: Validators assess AI outputs in the conceptual framework, inspired by Bittensor-style validation.
- **Staking Mechanism**: Agents require staking (simulated `$Chronoeffe`) to activate in the conceptual framework.
- **FastAPI Orchestrator**: Exposes endpoints to manage agents dynamically, with wallet-bound authentication simulation.
- **Modular Design**: Easily extensible for integrating ML models, external APIs, or Solana blockchain interactions.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/chronoeffector-ai.git
   cd chronoeffector-ai
2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
### Running the Conceptual Framework
```bash
python chronoeffector_framework.py
```

**Expected Output:**

- Deploys a sample sentiment analysis agent.
- Executes a task and validates it via simulated consensus.
- Unloads the agent and attempts execution again (fails as expected).

**Example output:**
```
Agent sentiment_agent_1 activated with stake 150
Agent sentiment_agent_1 deployed dynamically.
Task output validated: Sentiment analysis result for 'I love Solana!': Positive
Result: Sentiment analysis result for 'I love Solana!': Positive
Agent sentiment_agent_1 deactivated. Withdrawn: 150
Agent sentiment_agent_1 unloaded.
Result after unload: Agent not found.
```
### Running the FastAPI Orchestrator
```bash
python orchestrator.py
```
The API will be available at http://localhost:8000

**Interact with the API:**
Use curl, Postman, or a similar tool to test the endpoints.
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/deploy_agent" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"agent_id": "agent_1", "wallet_id": "wallet_123"}'
```

**Response:**
```
{"message": "Agent agent_1 deployed successfully", "wallet_id": "wallet_123", "loaded_at": <timestamp>}
```
**Execute a Task:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/execute_task" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"agent_id": "agent_1", "input_data": "Hello, Solana!"}'  
```

**Response:**
```
{"agent_id": "agent_1", "result": "Processed 'Hello, Solana!' by sample agent."}
```
**Unload an Agent:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/unload_agent" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"agent_id": "agent_1"}''
```
**Response:**
```
{"message": "Agent agent_1 unloaded successfully"}
```
**List Active Agents:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/list_agents"
```

**Response:**
```
{"active_agents":{"agent_1":{"wallet_id":"wallet_123","loaded_at":1741159139.760204}}}
```


## API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Request Body Example |
|----------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| /deploy_agent | POST | Deploy a new AI agent | {"agent_id": "agent_1", "wallet_id": "wallet_123"} |
| /execute_task | POST | Execute a task with an agent | {"agent_id": "agent_1", "input_data": "Hello"} |
| /unload_agent | POST | Unload an existing agent | {"agent_id": "agent_1"} |
| /list_agents | GET | List all active agents | N/A |


## Future Enhancements
- Solana Integration: Use solana-py for real blockchain interactions (staking, smart contracts).
- Advanced Agent Logic: Support loading ML models or external API integrations dynamically.
- Staking & Consensus: Fully implement staking and validator consensus in the orchestrator.
- Security: Add adversarial resistance (e.g., prompt injection checks) and wallet signature verification.
- Scalability: Optimize for Solana’s high-throughput model with real-world testing.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests to enhance the framework. Key areas for contribution:

- Real Solana blockchain integration.
- Additional AI agent examples (e.g., trading bots, NLP).
- Improved security and validation mechanisms.
